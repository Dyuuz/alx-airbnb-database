# alx-airbnb-database

This project designs and implements a relational database for an Airbnb-style platform.  
It models users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messages â€” ensuring data integrity, normalization (up to 3NF), and realistic relationships between entities.

The repository includes:
- **Database schema design**
- **Normalization documentation**
- **SQL scripts** for creating and seeding tables with sample data

This forms the foundation for managing property listings, user interactions, and booking transactions efficiently in a scalable system.
